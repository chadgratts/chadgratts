I built [Providence](https://providence-replay.github.io/), an open-source AI session replay tool that processes frontend event data and generates natural language summaries of user behavior. It's designed as a full 0â†’1 backend system, with custom data pipelines, chunking logic, vector search, and LLM-based retrieval workflows.

It supports both local and cloud deployment and is built for rapid iteration on prompts, embeddings, and model behavior.
